        "\n",
        "R Markdown files are designed to be used in three ways:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  For communicating to decision makers, who want to focus on the conclusions, not the code behind the analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  For collaborating with other data scientists (including future you!), who are interested in both your conclusions, and how you reached them (i.e. the code).\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  As an environment in which to *do* data science, as a modern day lab notebook where you can capture not only what you did, but also what you were thinking.\n",
        "\n",
        "R Markdown integrates a number of R packages and external tools.\n",
        "This means that help is, by-and-large, not available through `?`.\n",

        "Think of a chunk like a function.\n",
        "A chunk should be relatively self-contained, and focussed around a single task.\n",
        "\n",
        "The following sections describe the chunk header which consists of ```` ```{r ````, followed by an optional chunk name, followed by comma separated options, followed by `}`.\n",

        "Next, brainstorm all the things that might cause the bug.\n",
        "You'll need to systematically check that they're the same in your R session and your R Markdown session.\n",
        "The easiest way to do that is to set `error = TRUE` on the chunk causing the problem, then use `print()` and `str()` to check that settings are as you expect.\n",
