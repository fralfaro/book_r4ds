        "R Markdown provides a unified authoring framework for data science, combining your code, its results, and your prose commentary.\n",
        "R Markdown documents are fully reproducible and support dozens of output formats, like PDFs, Word files, slideshows, and more.\n",
        "\n",
        "R Markdown files are designed to be used in three ways:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  For communicating to decision makers, who want to focus on the conclusions, not the code behind the analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  For collaborating with other data scientists (including future you!), who are interested in both your conclusions, and how you reached them (i.e. the code).\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  As an environment in which to *do* data science, as a modern day lab notebook where you can capture not only what you did, but also what you were thinking.\n",
        "\n",
        "R Markdown integrates a number of R packages and external tools.\n",
        "This means that help is, by-and-large, not available through `?`.\n",

        "Think of a chunk like a function.\n",
        "A chunk should be relatively self-contained, and focussed around a single task.\n",
        "\n",
        "The following sections describe the chunk header which consists of ```` ```{r ````, followed by an optional chunk name, followed by comma separated options, followed by `}`.\n",

        "\n",
        "Chunk output can be customised with **options**, arguments supplied to chunk header.\n",

        "\n",

        "-   `echo = FALSE` prevents code, but not the results from appearing in the finished file.\n",

        "\n",

        "    This is rarely something you'll want to include in the final version of your report, but can be very useful if you need to debug exactly what is going on inside your `.Rmd`.\n",
        "    It's also useful if you're teaching R and want to deliberately include an error.\n",

        "However, it can be painful if you have some computations that take a long time.\n",

        "\n",
        "    `r chunk`{r raw_data}\n",

        "\n",
        "Caching the `processed_data` chunk means that it will get re-run if the dplyr pipeline is changed, but it won't get rerun if the `read_csv()` call changes.\n",
        "You can avoid that problem with the `dependson` chunk option:\n",
        "\n",
        "    `r chunk`{r processed_data, cache = TRUE, dependson = \"raw_data\"}\n",

        "\n",
        "Note that the chunks won't update if `a_very_large_file.csv` changes, because knitr caching only tracks changes within the `.Rmd` file.\n",
        "If you want to also track changes to that file you can use the `cache.extra` option.\n",
        "This is an arbitrary R expression that will invalidate the cache whenever it changes.\n",
        "A good function to use is `file.info()`: it returns a bunch of information about the file including when it was last modified.\n",
        "Then you can write:\n",
        "\n",
        "    `r chunk`{r raw_data, cache.extra = file.info(\"a_very_large_file.csv\")}\n",

        "### Global options\n",
        "\n",
        "As you work more with knitr, you will discover that some of the default chunk options don't fit your needs and you want to change them.\n",
        "You can do this by calling `knitr::opts_chunk$set()` in a code chunk.\n",
        "For example, when writing books and tutorials I set:\n",

        "\n",
        "```r\n",

        ")\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "That will hide the code by default, so only showing the chunks you deliberately choose to show (with `echo = TRUE`).\n",
        "You might consider setting `message = FALSE` and `warning = FALSE`, but that would make it harder to debug problems because you wouldn't see any messages in the final document.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Inline code\n",
        "\n",
        "There is one other way to embed R code into an R Markdown document: directly into the text, with: `r inline()`.\n",
        "This can be very useful if you mention properties of your data in the text.\n",
        "For example, in the example document I used at the start of the chapter I had:\n",
        "\n",
        "> We have data about `r inline('nrow(diamonds)')` diamonds.\n",

        "\n",
        "Troubleshooting R Markdown documents can be challenging because you are no longer in an interactive R environment, and you will need to learn some new tricks.\n",
        "The first thing you should always try is to recreate the problem in an interactive session.\n",
        "Restart R, then \"Run all chunks\" (either from Code menu, under Run region), or with the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + Alt + R.\n",
        "If you're lucky, that will recreate the problem, and you can figure out what's going on interactively.\n",
        "\n",
        "If that doesn't help, there must be something different between your interactive environment and the R Markdown environment.\n",
        "You're going to need to systematically explore the options.\n",
        "The most common difference is the working directory: the working directory of an R Markdown is the directory in which it lives.\n",
        "Check the working directory is what you expect by including `getwd()` in a chunk.\n",
        "\n",
        "Next, brainstorm all the things that might cause the bug.\n",
        "You'll need to systematically check that they're the same in your R session and your R Markdown session.\n",
        "The easiest way to do that is to set `error = TRUE` on the chunk causing the problem, then use `print()` and `str()` to check that settings are as you expect.\n",
        "\n",
        "## YAML header\n",
        "\n",
        "You can control many other \"whole document\" settings by tweaking the parameters of the YAML header.\n",
        "You might wonder what YAML stands for: it's \"yet another markup language\", which is designed for representing hierarchical data in a way that's easy for humans to read and write.\n",
        "R Markdown uses it to control many details of the output.\n",
        "Here we'll discuss two: document parameters and bibliographies.\n",

        "### Parameters\n",
        "\n",
        "R Markdown documents can include one or more parameters whose values can be set when you render the report.\n",
        "Parameters are useful when you want to re-render the same report with distinct values for various key inputs.\n",
        "For example, you might be producing sales reports per branch, exam results by student, or demographic summaries by country.\n",
