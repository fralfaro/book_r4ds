        "The goal of a model is to provide a simple low-dimensional summary of a dataset. In the context of this book we're going to use models to partition data into patterns and residuals. Strong patterns will hide subtler trends, so we'll use models to help peel back layers of structure as we explore a dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, before we can start using models on interesting, real, datasets, you need to understand the basics of how models work. For that reason, this chapter of the book is unique because it uses only simulated datasets. These datasets are very simple, and not at all interesting, but they will help you understand the essence of modelling before you apply the same techniques to real data in the next chapter.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are two parts to a model:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  First, you define a __family of models__ that express a precise, but \n",
        "    generic, pattern that you want to capture. For example, the pattern \n",
        "    might be a straight line, or a quadratic curve. You will express\n",
        "    the model family as an equation like `y = a_1 * x + a_2` or \n",
        "    `y = a_1 * x ^ a_2`. Here, `x` and `y` are known variables from your\n",
        "    data, and `a_1` and `a_2` are parameters that can vary to capture \n",
        "    different patterns.\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  Next, you generate a __fitted model__ by finding the model from the \n",
        "    family that is the closest to your data. This takes the generic model \n",
        "    family and makes it specific, like `y = 3 * x + 7` or `y = 9 * x ^ 2`.\n",
        "\n",
        "It's important to understand that a fitted model is just the closest model from a family of models. That implies that you have the \"best\" model (according to some criteria); it doesn't imply that you have a good model and it certainly doesn't imply that the model is \"true\". George Box puts this well in his famous aphorism:\n",

        "> an \"ideal\" gas via a constant R is not exactly true for any real gas, but it \n",

        "> molecules.\n",
        "> \n",
        "> For such a model there is no need to ask the question \"Is the model true?\". \n",
        "> If \"truth\" is to be the \"whole truth\" the answer must be \"No\". The only \n",
        "> question of interest is \"Is the model illuminating and useful?\".\n",

If you forget the `I()` and specify `y ~ x ^ 2 + x`, R will compute `y ~ x * x + x`. `x * x` means the interaction of `x` with itself, which is the same as `x`.

There are a large set of model classes that extend the linear model in various interesting ways. Some of them are:\n",

Now that you've learned some general tools and one useful class of models, you can go on and learn more classes from other sources.\n"
