        "At first glance, dates and times seem simple.\n",
        "You use them all the time in your regular life, and they don't seem to cause much confusion.\n",
        "However, the more you learn about dates and times, the more complicated they seem to get.\n",
        "To warm up, try these three seemingly simple questions:\n",
        "\n",
        "-   Does every year have 365 days?\n",
        "-   Does every day have 24 hours?\n",
        "-   Does every minute have 60 seconds?\n",
        "\n",
        "I'm sure you know that not every year has 365 days, but do you know the full rule for determining if a year is a leap year?\n",
        "(It has three parts.) You might have remembered that many parts of the world use daylight savings time (DST), so that some days have 23 hours, and others have 25.\n",
        "You might not have known that some minutes have 61 seconds because every now and then leap seconds are added because the Earth's rotation is gradually slowing down.\n",
        "\n",
        "Dates and times are hard because they have to reconcile two physical phenomena (the rotation of the Earth and its orbit around the sun) with a whole raft of geopolitical phenomena including months, time zones, and DST.\n",
        "This chapter won't teach you every last detail about dates and times, but it will give you a solid grounding of practical skills that will help you with common data analysis challenges.\n",

        "### Prerequisites\n",

        "\n",
        "-   A **date**.\n",

        "    Tibbles print this as `<dttm>`.\n",
        "    Elsewhere in R these are called POSIXct, but I don't think that's a very useful name.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this chapter we are only going to focus on dates and date-times as R doesn't have a native class for storing times.\n",
        "If you need one, you can use the **hms** package.\n",

        "That means if you can use a date instead of a date-time, you should.\n",

        "\n",
        "The first challenge is that everyday names of time zones tend to be ambiguous.\n",
        "For example, if you're American you're probably familiar with EST, or Eastern Standard Time.\n",
        "However, both Australia and Canada also have EST!\n",
        "To avoid confusion, R uses the international standard IANA time zones.\n",
        "These use a consistent naming scheme \"<area>/<location>\", typically in the form \"\\<continent\\>/\\<city\\>\" (there are a few exceptions because not every country lies on a continent).\n",
        "Examples include \"America/New_York\", \"Europe/Paris\", and \"Pacific/Auckland\".\n",
        "\n",
        "You might wonder why the time zone uses a city, when typically you think of time zones as associated with a country or region within a country.\n",
        "This is because the IANA database has to record decades worth of time zone rules.\n",
        "In the course of decades, countries change names (or break apart) fairly frequently, but city names tend to stay the same.\n",
        "Another problem is that the name needs to reflect not only the current behaviour, but also the complete history.\n",
        "For example, there are time zones for both \"America/New_York\" and \"America/Detroit\".\n",
        "These cities both currently use Eastern Standard Time but in 1969-1972 Michigan (the state in which Detroit is located), did not follow DST, so it needs a different name.\n",
        "It's worth reading the raw time zone database (available at <http://www.iana.org/time-zones>) just to read some of these stories!\n",
