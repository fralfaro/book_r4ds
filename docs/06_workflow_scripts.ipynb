        "To give yourself more room to work, it's a great idea to use the script editor.\n",
        "Open it up either by clicking the File menu, and selecting New File, then R script, or using the keyboard shortcut Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + N.\n",

        "Keep experimenting in the console, but once you have written code that works and does what you want, put it in the script editor.\n",
        "RStudio will automatically save the contents of the editor when you quit RStudio, and will automatically load it when you re-open.\n",
        "Nevertheless, it's a good idea to save your scripts regularly and to back them up.\n",

        "\n",
        "The script editor is also a great place to build up complex ggplot2 plots or long sequences of dplyr manipulations.\n",
        "The key to using the script editor effectively is to memorize one of the most important keyboard shortcuts: Cmd/Ctrl + Enter.\n",
        "This executes the current R expression in the console.\n",
        "For example, take the code below.\n",
        "If your cursor is at █, pressing Cmd/Ctrl + Enter will run the complete command that generates `not_cancelled`.\n",
        "It will also move the cursor to the next statement (beginning with `not_cancelled |>`).\n",
        "That makes it easy to step through your complete script by repeatedly pressing Cmd/Ctrl + Enter.\n",

        "\n",
        "Instead of running your code expression-by-expression, you can also execute the complete script in one step: Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + S.\n",
        "Doing this regularly is a great way to ensure that you've captured all the important parts of your code in the script.\n",
        "\n",
        "I recommend that you always start your script with the packages that you need.\n",
        "That way, if you share your code with others, they can easily see which packages they need to install.\n",
        "Note, however, that you should never include `install.packages()` or `setwd()` in a script that you share.\n",
        "It's very antisocial to change settings on someone else's computer!\n",
        "\n",
        "When working through future chapters, I highly recommend starting in the script editor and practicing your keyboard shortcuts.\n",
        "Over time, sending code to the console in this way will become so natural that you won't even think about it.\n",
