        "    R can work with either type (no matter what platform you're currently using), but unfortunately, backslashes mean something special to R, and to get a single backslash in the path, you need to type two backslashes!\n",
        "    That makes life frustrating, so I recommend always using the Linux/Mac style with forward slashes.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  Absolute paths (i.e. paths that point to the same place regardless of your working directory) look different.\n",
        "    In Windows they start with a drive letter (e.g. `C:`) or two backslashes (e.g. `\\\\servername`) and in Mac/Linux they start with a slash \"/\" (e.g. `/users/hadley`).\n",
        "    You should **never** use absolute paths in your scripts, because they hinder sharing: no one else will have exactly the same directory configuration as you.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  The last minor difference is the place that `~` points to.\n",
        "    `~` is a convenient shortcut to your home directory.\n",
        "    Windows doesn't really have the notion of a home directory, so it instead points to your documents directory.\n",
